# Liam-Deering-Lsbu-game-programing-Packages


This project will contain my four packages for progaming for the module.
These are a counting system, 3d movement controls, grapple gun and a pixel shader.


Read Me For the Packages


-----3D Movment ------
For this first drag the player prefab and then camera prefab into the scene. 
Then on the camera object there variable called, expand the player object to view the child object find on called “head” and place in the camera variable Called player. 
Then create a new layer and preferably call it ground, any object you want the player to be able to run and slide give the ground layer and also apply the physics included called grounds 


------Pixel Shader------
Drag the script shader Handler onto the main camera then drag the material called “pixlation” into variable called effect material.




-----Count System ------
Simply drag the canvas object and the game object into your scene and in the game called “game object” put the text object which is a child of the canvas into that variable.

Then attach the script point instance onto any object you want to be collected and have add points
